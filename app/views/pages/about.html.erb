    <h1>Hey, I'm Thomas :)</h1>
    <p>Welcome to week 2 of my 12 Web Apps in 12 Weeks Challenge.</p>
    <p>This week I built a blog in Rails 5. You're actually on the demo application right now.
    Cool stuff, right!.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to follow along as I learn more Ruby on Rails, find me on Facebook.
